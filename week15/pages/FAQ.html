				                                   All of our insects come from insect farms located all across the world, many in tropical regions.  These farms raise insects as a source of income instead of destroying the landscape and forests to log, farm, or raise livestock.  Simply put, farming saves rainforests and protects insect populations.  We are licensed with the US Fish & Wildlife Service and comply with all US and International Import/Export Laws and Regulations.  Buying butterflies and insects, dead or alive, has rules and regulations that we must be in compliance with.  Import and export requirements are regulated by The US Fish and Wildlife Service and further by International Law and Treaties that the US Government has entered into with other nations.</p>

				                                   Many insects have short lifespans. Some insect specimens live only a few weeks as an adult, others only a few days. Most of our butterflies and insects come from Insect Farms where the specimens are taken through their whole life-cycle and bred to ensure a new generation before death. Those specimens that do not die of natural causes are humanely killed. Specimens that are not from farms come only from licensed breeders and professional field collectors, this helps ensure our material is sustainably and ethically sourced. Your purchases will help the farming industry continue without threats to the natural wild populations of butterflies and insects. Please know that the biggest threat to the survival of most everything living creature on this planet, including insects, remains habitat loss. Unlike birds and mammals for instance, who have smaller numbers of young and often only one group of offspring per season, insects often have large numbers of offspring and can have multiple generations per season. Insect collecting in any given habitat will not pose a significant threat to that species survival. Insects disappear from an area when they lose habitat and thus their host plants and food source. Other factors affecting insect populations are environmental pollution and agricultural chemicals. If insects are dear to your heart you can get involved by helping preserve natural areas in or around your local community and across the world. Leaving some wild flowers and weeds in your yard or planting them is a great way to give insects a boost!</p>

				                                <p>We do not work with insects that are endangered or restricted. There are strict laws protecting endangered species in many countries, including insects.  Many countries require permits, and customs forms to sell insects internationally.  We only use insects from farms that file the proper documentation for legal insect sales. Our shipments from outside the US are inspected for compliance with these rules and regulations. Insect farms are also part of the conservation effort for many insect species, as they help ensure that those insect will be found in the wild for years to come. Our support and yours for their operations and livelihood will ensure that these insect farmers remain good stewards who can run a sustainable and environmentally friendly business in geographic areas that often do not value those ideals.</p>

The wood used in all our frames is FSC certified and the paper backing we mount all our insects on is made using acid-free hydroelectric power. We use eco-friendly packing paper in every box we ship, and you can help us by recycling the box and packing materials after they arrive.  All our business cards and promotional materials are printed on recycled paper. </p>
